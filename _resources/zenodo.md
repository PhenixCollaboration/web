[Zenodo](https://about.zenodo.org/){:target="_blank"} is an Open Science Digital Repository launched at CERN in 2013. Its operation is governed by a set of [defined principles](https://about.zenodo.org/principles/). It features a rich set of [search capabilities](https://about.zenodo.org/principles/){:target="_blank"} and is backed up by a [robust infrastructure](https://about.zenodo.org/infrastructure/){:target="_blank"}.

The PHENIX Collaboration has elected to use this platform as one of the principal component of its Data and Analysis Preservation effort. Zenodo supports the concept of the "community" whereby documents submitted for archival are curated and become a part of the community collection. Correspondingly, the [PHENIX Community on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/communities/phenixcollaboration/){:target="_blank"} has been created and is actively managed, with new uploads being routinely added.
