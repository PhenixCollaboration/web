#### Detector Overview
The PHENIX drift chamber was a multiwire gaseous detector located at a radial distance of 2.02 &lt; R &lt; 2.48 m. There was one chamber on each arm, and they were mirror copies of each other, each one subtending 90<sup>&deg;</sup> in azimuth and 2 m along the z direction. The DC
measured the trajectories of charged particles in the r-&phi; plane in order to determine their charge and transverse momentum p<sub>T</sub> .
A detailed description about PHENIX Drift Chambers (DC) can be found in the following publication.
