      PHENIX, the Pioneering High Energy Nuclear Interaction eXperiment, is the largest of
      the four experiments that have taken data at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.
      Data-taking was finished in 2016 and the PHENIX Collaboration is now analyzing large data
      samples previously collected, prioritizing those with a unique physics reach.<br/>
      <br/>
      This website has been created by the Collaboration to support its Data and Analysis Preservation effort.
      Materials are collected from legacy web resources, curated and systematized for placement on this site.
      New content is created with the specific purpose of aiding in the long-term analysis preservation. This effort leverages
      best practices and tools developed in the High Energy and Nuclear Physics communities such as Zenodo, HEPData and Open Data portals.
