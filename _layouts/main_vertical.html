	    <p class="lead announcement">
      PHENIX, the Pioneering High Energy Nuclear Interaction eXperiment, is the largest of
      the four experiments that have taken data at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.
      Data-taking was finished in 2016 and the PHENIX Collaboration is currently analyzing large data
      samples previously collected.<br/><br/>
      This website was created by the Collaboration to support its Data and Analysis Preservation effort.
      Materials are collected from legacy web resources, curated and systematized for placement on this site.
      This effort leverages best practices and tools developed in the High Energy and Nuclear Physics
      communities such as Zenodo, HEPData and Open Data portals. PHENIX has succeeded in containerization
      of its analysis software environment, which promotes analysis preservation and opens
      possibilities of using platforms like REANA for these purposes.</p>
