	      PHENIX, the Pioneering High Energy Nuclear Interaction eXperiment,
	      is an exploratory experiment for the investigation of high energy collisions of heavy ions and protons.
	      It is the largest of the four experiments that have taken data at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.
	      Data-taking was finished in 2016 and the PHENIX Collaboration is now analyzing large data
	      samples collected, prioritizing those with a unique physics reach.
