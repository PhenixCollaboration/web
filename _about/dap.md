This Web site has been created with the goal to support the Data and Analysis Preservation (DAP)
mandate of the PHENIX Collaboration. Content from a few legacy PHENIX Web sites and other
information resources is being
curated, systematized and included here in a way that is helpful to the present and future
researchers performing or revisiting analyses of the PHENIX data.
