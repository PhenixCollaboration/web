This Web site has been created with the goal to support the Data and Analysis Preservation (DAP)
mandate of the PHENIX Collaboration. Content from multiple legacy PHENIX and RHIC Web sites and other
information resources is being curated, systematized and included here in a way that is helpful
to the present and future researchers performing or revisiting analyses of the PHENIX data.
