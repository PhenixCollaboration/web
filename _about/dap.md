### What is DAP?
Since the second decade of the century the term **Data and Analysis Preservation** (DAP)
is often used in the place of the traditional "data preservation" to account for
the fact that data which canâ€™t be analyzed is useless. DAP is commonly described as a union of
* Bit preservation (e.g. data on tape and relevant management policies and techniques)
* Long-term management and preservation of the software infrastructure and application code
* Analysis know-how (knowledge management)

### This site
This Web site has been created with the goal to support the **Data and Analysis Preservation** (DAP)
mandate of the PHENIX Collaboration.

Content from multiple legacy PHENIX and RHIC Web sites and other
information resources is being curated, systematized and included here in a way that is helpful
to the present and future researchers performing or revisiting analyses of the PHENIX data.
