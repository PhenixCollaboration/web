#### What is DAP?
Since the second decade of the 21<sup>st</sup> century the term **Data and Analysis Preservation** (DAP)
is often used in place of the traditional "data preservation" to account for
the fact that data which canâ€™t be analyzed is useless. DAP is commonly described as a union of
* **Bit preservation** (e.g. data on tape and relevant management policies and techniques). PHENIX relies on capabilities and infrastructure the Scientific Data and Computing Center (SDCC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory for the long-term preservation of the experiment's data
including the raw data, conditions-type data, simulated and processed data.
* Long-term **management and preservation of the software infrastructure and application code**. PHENIX is using version control (CVS and git) to manage its code, and virtual machine (VM) technology to manage the software configuration.
* **Analysis know-how** (knowledge management). The Collaboration has undertaken an effort to review, curate, systematize and preserve knowledge necessary for the analysis of the data. Creation, development and maintenance of this website is a part of this effort.


#### The Role of This Site
This website has been created with the goal to support the **Data and Analysis Preservation** (DAP)
mandate of the PHENIX Collaboration, and more specifically to aid the **Knolwedge Management** aspect of it.
Content from multiple legacy PHENIX and RHIC Web sites and various other information resources is being curated,
systematized and included here in a way that is helpful to the present and future researchers performing
or revisiting analyses of the PHENIX data.

**The site is not a substitute for the PHENIX Wiki** or any other comparable content management
system used to keep information which is subject to changes or pages used as a scratch pad
to for developing analyses or other topics. The *long-term* knowledge management is the key
in shaping the content hosted here.

#### The Platform
The following considerations are important for long-term viability of the site:
* ease of maintenance
* security
* performance
* portability

In order to meet these criteria this website relies on modern static
website generator technology with the following features:
* separation of content (including text as well as numeric data and graphics) from the layout of individual pages as well as of the website as whole
* management of potentially complex structured data without reliance on databases, by keeping data in JSON, YAML and CSV formats
* use of a highly readable and an easy-to-edit syntax for content creation (the so-called *Markdown* syntax)

To this end, the popular <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> website generator is used, with
additional tools (Javascript libraries and advanced stylesheets) for optimal user experience.
