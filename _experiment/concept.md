The PHENIX Collaboration performs basic research with high energy collisions of heavy ions and protons. The primary mission of PHENIX is the following:
* Search for a new state of matter called the Quark-Gluon Plasma, which is believed to be the state of matter existing in the universe shortly after the Big Bang. PHENIX data suggest that a new form of matter has indeed been discovered, and that it behaves like a perfect fluid. PHENIX scientists are now working to study its properties.
* Study matter under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure.
* Learn where the proton gets its spin.
* Study the most basic building blocks of nature and the forces that govern them.
* Create a map of the Quantum Chromodynamics phase diagram.
