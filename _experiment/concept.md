# The Concept

The PHENIX Collaboration conducts research with high energy collisions of heavy ions and protons. The primary mission of PHENIX is the following:
* Search for a new state of matter called the Quark-Gluon Plasma, which is believed to be the state of matter existing in the universe shortly after the Big Bang. The data obtained by PHENIX suggest that a new form of matter has indeed been discovered, and that it behaves like a perfect fluid.
* Study matter under extreme conditions of temperature and pressure, and create a map of the Quantum Chromodynamics phase diagram.
* Learn where the proton gets its spin.
* Study the most basic building blocks of nature and the forces that govern them.

PHENIX finished taking data in 2016 however a number of analyses are continuing, including those with a physic reach unique to PHENIX.
