#### Obtain BNL Appointment and Account

To join, please
{% include navigation/pagelink.md folder=site.experiment name='contact' tag='make contact' %}
with the PHENIX Collaboration. Once approved to join, the initial steps are:

1.  Register with the Users Center to get a valid guest user appointment.
    _Note:  If the institution is also new, then a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is needed between BNL and the institution._

2.  Obtain a [BNL SDCC](https://www.sdcc.bnl.gov/){:target="_blank"}
user account. This is important for a few reasons, including getting access
to the internal PHENIX website (via SSH tunnel or VPN).

#### Update User Database

Once the user account is active, access the _internal_ website
and enter personal information on this form:
* __https://phenix-intra.sdcc.bnl.gov/WWW/forms/collab/addNewPerson.php__

It may take some time for the database changes to propagate.
