# History

### August 1991
PHENIX is born from the merger of proposals named TALES, SPARC, OASIS, and DIMUON.

### 1991-2000
PHENIX is designed, built, and installed at RHIC.

### December 1998
PHENIX survives a flood after torrential rain partially submerged some of the electronics.

### June 15, 2000 at 6:28 am EDT
PHENIX records its first relativistic heavy ion collision.

### Summer of 2000
RHIC Run-1. PHENIX takes data from reduced RHIC energy Gold-Gold collisions.

### February 27, 2001
The first PHENIX physics paper is accepted for publication by the Physical Review Letters scientific journal.

### May 2001 through January 2002
RHIC Run-2. PHENIX takes data from full RHIC energy Gold-Gold and polarized proton-proton collisions.

### March 2003 through May 2003
RHIC Run-3. PHENIX takes data from full RHIC energy deuteron-Gold and polarized proton-proton collisions.

### June 18, 2003
All four RHIC experiments, including PHENIX, release the first results from deuteron-Gold collisions, which confirm that a new state of matter with unique properties has been seen in Gold-Gold collisions at RHIC.

### December 2003 through May 2004
RHIC Run-4. PHENIX takes more data from full RHIC energy Gold-Gold and polarized proton-proton collisions.

### December 2004 through May 2005
RHIC Run-5. PHENIX takes more data from full RHIC energy Copper-Copper and polarized proton-proton collisions.

### April 2005
The RHIC experiments announce the discovery of perfect liquid matter in RHIC collisions.

### December 2004 through May 2005
PHENIX publishes 3 papers in a single edition of the Physical Review Letters scientific journal.

### March 2006 through June 2006
RHIC Run-6. PHENIX takes more data from full RHIC energy polarized proton-proton collisions. Thanks to Renaissance Technologies for funding RHIC Run-6!

### May 2007 through July 2007
RHIC Run-7. PHENIX takes much more data from full RHIC energy gold-gold collisions.

### November 2007 through March 2008
RHIC Run-8. PHENIX takes much more data from full RHIC energy deuteron-gold and polarized proton-proton collisions.

### June 2008
The PHENIX White paper publication achieves reknowned status, receiving more than 500 scientific citations in scientific journals.

### February 2009 through April 2009
RHIC Run-9. PHENIX records data from polarized proton-proton collisions with collision energies of 200 GeV and 500 GeV.

### February 2010
PHENIX makes the news following an announcement that the temperature in a RHIC collision is hot enough to produce a Quark-Gluon Plasma.

### January 2010 through June 2010
RHIC Run-10. The new Hadron Blind Detector is installed. The RHIC beam energy scan program begins with gold-gold collisions at 200 GeV, 62.4 GeV, 39 GeV, and 7.7 GeV taken by PHENIX. STAR also takes data from 11 GeV gold-gold collisions.

### February 2011 through June 2011
RHIC Run-11. The new Silicon Vertex Tracker is installed. PHENIX records data from 500 GeV proton-proton collisions and 200 GeV gold-gold collisions.  The RHIC beam energy scan program continues with gold-gold collisions at 19.6 GeV and 27 GeV.

### December 5, 2011
PHENIX celebrates its 20th anniversary with a symposium at Brookhaven National Laboratory.

### 2016
PHENIX finishes data taking.
