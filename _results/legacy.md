##### Data Archive

At the time of writing, [HEPData]({% link _results/hepdata_policy.md %})
is the main tool for preserving data used in publications
and its use is mandated by the Collaboration.
Previously, the PHENIX Collaboration has kept publication-related
data (data points, tables etc) in a custom-built file-based
archive in various formats, most often as plain text files.


Since migration of the PHENIX Web site to a new type of service
such legacy data has become unavailable to users outside
of RHIC facilities. To mitigate this situation, portions
of these data are kept on this website in the original
format, on dedicated pages conforming to the
the original convention, so links previously disseminated
are still functional. Examples:
