##### Publication Data Archive

The PHENIX Collaboration has kept publication-related
data such as data points and tables in a custom-built
archive which predated wide use of HEPData for same
purposes. Since the upgrade of the PHENIX Web site such
legacy data has become unavailable to users outside
of RHIC facilities. To mitigate this situation, parts
of these data are kept on this website in the original
format, on a dedicated page conforming to the
the original convention, for example:
 <a href="{{ wwwURL }}" target="_blank">/WWW/info/data/ppg216_data.html</a>.


{{site.WWW.info.data }}
