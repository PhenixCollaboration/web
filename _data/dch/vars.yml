- name: get_npart
  type: int
  code: virtual int get_npart(/*args*/) const;
  desc: Total number of tracks/particles in a givem event

- name: get_quality
  type: short
  code: virtual short get_quality(/*args*/) const;
  desc: Quality of the Drift Chamber tracks

- name: get_zed
  type: float
  code: virtual float get_zed(/*args*/) const;
  desc: z coordinate at which the track crosses PC1

- name: get_phi
  type: float
  code: virtual float get_phi(/*args*/) const;
  desc: phi coordinate at which the track crosses the drift chamber reference radius

- name: get_alpha
  type: float
  code: virtual float get_alpha(/*args*/) const;
  desc: Inclination of the track w.r.t. an infinite momentum track. Hence, pT is roughly proportional to 1/alpha. This value comes from the straight line fit and does not respect residual bends

- name: get_beta
  type: float
  code: virtual float get_beta(/*args*/) const;
  desc: This is essentially the spherical coordinate "THETA" of the track vector as it passes through the drift chamber reference radius

- name: get_phi0
  type: float
  code: virtual float get_phi0(/*args*/) const;
  desc: Track's phi direction at the vertex

- name: get_the0
  type: float
  code: virtual float get_the0(/*args*/) const;
  desc: Track's theta direction at the vertex

- name: get_mom
  type: float
  code: virtual float get_mom(/*args*/) const;
  desc: Magnitude of the momentum

- name: get_px
  type: float
  code: virtual float get_px(/*args*/) const;
  desc: Momentum along X-direction

- name: get_py
  type: float
  code: virtual float get_py(/*args*/) const;
  desc: Momentum along Y-direction

- name: get_pz
  type: float
  code: virtual float get_pz(/*args*/) const;
  desc: Momentum along Z-direction

- name: get_E
  type: float
  code: virtual float get_E(/*args*/) const;
  desc: Energy estimated using DC

- name: get_charge
  type: short
  code: virtual short get_charge(/*args*/) const;
  desc: Returns charge of the track
