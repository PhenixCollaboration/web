##### Overview
{% include navigation/findlink.md name='reana' tag='REANA' %}
is a reproducible research data analysis *platform* developed at CERN.
It is considered for Analysis Preservation in PHENIX due to the following features:

* Unambiguous description of workflows (encoded in a YAML schema)
* Capture and preservation of both the software and the software environment by using **containerization**

REANA workflows can be represented as *Directed Acyclic Graphs* which is reflected in
the YAML schema based on the 
{% include navigation/findlink.md name='cwl' tag='Common Workflow Language (CWL)' -%}.
Each computational component of a workflow may require a separate and distinct
{% include navigation/pagelink.md folder=site.analysis name='docker' tag='Docker container' -%}.

Execution of workflows in REANA requires a properly configured **REANA cluster**.
One such cluster is available to CERN users, and there are instances at other institutions.
There is also a test instance currently being evaluated at BNL and it is available on the
internal BNL network only. *Access to REANA clusters is controlled by their administrators
granting access tokens to qualified users*. The user (or an automated agent) interacts
with a REANA cluster via its network interface (HTTPS).

##### Getting Started
To be able to access a REANA cluster the user must be issued an access token by the administrators
(this may be specific to each institution REANA is hosted and typically involves visiting the requisite Web page).

A SSH tunnel is required to access the REANA cluster at BNL. Assuming a token has been obtained
a test session might look like this:
```bash
# create new virtual environment
virtualenv ~/.virtualenvs/reana
source ~/.virtualenvs/reana/bin/activate
# install reana-client (may need sudo)
pip install reana-client
# set REANA environment variables for the client
export REANA_SERVER_URL=https://localhost:30443
export REANA_ACCESS_TOKEN=________ # user's REANA token
# clone and run a simple analysis example
git clone https://github.com/reanahub/reana-demo-root6-roofit
cd reana-demo-root6-roofit
reana-client run -w root6-roofit
```
By default the client will look up the workflow definition from the file ```reana.yaml```.
This is just a standard example but any properly formulated workflow can be run in a similar manner e.g.
```bash
reana-client run -f my_workflow_file.yaml -w my_custom_workflow_name
```

Progress of REANA workflows can be tracked in the Web-based GUI provided by each cluster
or via the CLI, *reana-client*. Likewise, outputs files generated by the workflows (including the example
above) are available for download both via the GUI and the CLI.

##### Useful Options
List of (many) commands that can be used with the client can be easily referenced by
using its ```--help``` option. There are also other options, some of the more
useful ones are listed here (mostly overriding default values):
```bash
-w name of the workflow
-t access token
-f file (default is "reana.yaml")
-o path to the directory where the files are to be downloaded
```
