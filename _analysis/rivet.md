The Rivet toolkit (Robust Independent Validation of Experiment and Theory) is currently under evaluation by PHENIX. According to the {% include navigation/findlink.md name='rivet' tag='Rivet website' %}
> The Rivet toolkit (Robust Independent Validation of Experiment and Theory) is a system for validation of Monte Carlo event generators. It provides a large (and ever growing) set of experimental analyses useful for MC generator development, validation, and tuning, as well as a convenient infrastructure for adding your own analyses.
>
> Rivet is the most widespread way by which analysis code from the LHC and other high-energy collider experiments is preserved for comparison to and development of future theory models. It is used by phenomenologists, MC generator developers, and experimentalists on the LHC and other facilities.

Rivet is currently actively evaluated by RHIC physicists and a dedicated wokrshop was conducted in Fall'20.
