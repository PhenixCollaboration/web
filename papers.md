#### PHENIX Web services migration

The PHENIX Collaboration is currently undertaking an effort to update
its Web services and consolidate the available information information resources,
including those pertaining to its publications. As a result, the legacy pages are
being migrated to the new platform (this website). Migration of the data component
(e.g. the data tables) is also underway but is not currently complete.

PHENIX is working to upload publication-related data to the
{% include navigation/pagelink.md folder=site.results name='hepdata' tag='HEPData' %}
service at CERN and aims to eventually make all its data available in this manner,
replacing the legacy text-based source. Collection of the PHENIX HEPData uploads is
available as a
{% include navigation/pagelink.md folder=site.results name='hepdata_uploads' tag='catalog on this web site' %}
or directly on the
{% include navigation/findlink.md name='PHENIX on HEPData' tag='HEPData site' %}.
